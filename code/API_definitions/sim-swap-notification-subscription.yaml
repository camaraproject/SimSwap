  title: Sim Swap Notification Subscription
  description: |
    This API provides the customer with the ability to subscribe to event related to a sim swap operation performed on an associated phone number.

    # Introduction

    This API empowers service providers and network operators with a seamless mechanism for managing and monitoring SIM card swaps, a process often used in legitimate device upgrades or replacements but also susceptible to abuse in fraudulent activities.

    # Relevant terms and definitions

    * **SIM swap**:
    A SIM swap is a process in which a mobile phone user's current SIM card is deactivated or replaced with a new one. This is typically done by contacting the user's mobile service provider and requesting a new SIM card for various reasons, such as a lost or damaged SIM card, upgrading to a new phone, or changing phone numbers while keeping the same device.

    # API Functionality

    The API exposes following capabilities:
      * **/subscriptions**: This endpoint has two operations, one that allows to retrieve the list of Sim Swap event subscriptions and another one to create new event subscriptions.
      * **/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}**: This endpoint also has two operations, one that allows to retrieve a particular event subscription by id and another one to delete an event subscription also using the id.

    ## Sim Swap notification subscription

    Theses endpoints allow to manage notification subscription on Sim Swap event.
    The CAMARA subscription model is detailed in the CAMARA API design guideline document and follows Cloudevents specification.

    It is mandatory in the subscription to provide the event `type` subscribed are several are managed in this API.

    Only one event ``type`` is managed for this API:
      - ``org.camaraproject.sim-swap.v0.swapped`` - Event triggered when a sim swap occurs on the associated phoneNumber


    Note: Additionally to these list, ``org.camaraproject.sim-swap.v0.subscription-ends`` notification `type` is sent when the subscription ends.
    This notification does not require dedicated subscription.
    It is used when:
      - the subscription expire time (optionally set by the requester) has been reached
      - the maximum number of subscription events (optionally set by the requester) has been reached
      - the API server has to stop sending notification prematurely

    ### Notification callback

    This endpoint describes the event notification received on subscription listener side when the event occurred. As for subscription, detailed description of the event notification is provided in the CAMARA API design guideline document.

    **WARNING**: This callback endpoint must be exposed on the listener side as `POST /{$request.body#/webhook/notificationUrl}`
      will be posted by the sim swap resource server to the webhook url provided by notification
      listener.

    # Authorization and authentication

    CAMARA guidelines defines a set of authorization flows which can grant API clients access to the API functionality, as outlined in the document [CAMARA-API-access-and-user-consent.md](https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/blob/main/documentation/CAMARA-API-access-and-user-consent.md). Which specific authorization flows are to be used will be determined during onboarding process, happening between the API Client and the Telco Operator exposing the API, taking into account the declared purpose for accessing the API, while also being subject to the prevailing legal framework dictated by local legislation.

    It is important to remark that in cases where personal user data is processed by the API, and users can exercise their rights through mechanisms such as opt-in and/or opt-out, the use of 3-legged access tokens becomes mandatory. This measure ensures that the API remains in strict compliance with user privacy preferences and regulatory obligations, upholding the principles of transparency and user-centric data control.
