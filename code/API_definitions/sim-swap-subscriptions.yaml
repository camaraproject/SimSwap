  title: Sim Swap Subscriptions
  description: |
    This API provides the customer with the ability to subscribe to event related to a sim swap operation performed on an associated phone number.

    # Introduction

    This API empowers service providers and network operators with a seamless mechanism for managing and monitoring SIM card swaps, a process often used in legitimate device upgrades or replacements but also susceptible to abuse in fraudulent activities.

    # Relevant terms and definitions

    * **SIM swap**:
    A SIM swap is a process in which a mobile phone user's current SIM card is deactivated or replaced with a new one. This is typically done by contacting the user's mobile service provider and requesting a new SIM card for various reasons, such as a lost or damaged SIM card, upgrading to a new phone, or changing phone numbers while keeping the same device.

    # API Functionality

    The API exposes following capabilities:
      * **/subscriptions**: This endpoint has two operations, one that allows to retrieve the list of Sim Swap event subscriptions and another one to create new event subscriptions.
      * **/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}**: This endpoint also has two operations, one that allows to retrieve a particular event subscription by id and another one to delete an event subscription also using the id.

    ## Sim Swap notification subscription

    Theses endpoints allow to manage notification subscription on Sim Swap event.
    The CAMARA subscription model is detailed in the CAMARA API design guideline document and follows Cloudevents specification.

    It is mandatory in the subscription to provide the event `types` subscribed are several are managed in this API.

    Only one event ``types`` is managed for this API:
      - ``org.camaraproject.sim-swap-subscriptions.v0.swapped`` - Event triggered when a sim swap occurs on the associated phoneNumber


    Note: Additionally to these list, ``org.camaraproject.sim-swap-subscriptions.v0.subscription-ended`` notification `types` is sent when the subscription ends.
    This notification does not require dedicated subscription.
    It is used when:
      - the subscription expiration time (optionally set by the requester) has been reached
      - the maximum number of subscription events (optionally set by the requester) has been reached
      - the subscription was deleted by the requester
      - the API server has to stop sending notification prematurely
      - the Access Token sinkCredential expiration time (set by the requester) has been reached

    ### Notification callback

    This endpoint describes the event notification received on subscription listener side when the event occurred. As for subscription, detailed description of the event notification is provided in the CAMARA API design guideline document.

    **WARNING**: This callback endpoint must be exposed on the listener side as `POST /{$request.body#/sink}`
      will be posted by the sim swap resource server to the webhook url provided by notification
      listener.

    ### Data Minimization

      #### phoneNumber presence:
      These rules apply for subscription:

      - If 3-legged access token is used, the POST and GET{id} requests & responses must NOT provide the ``phoneNumber``. For GET (list) only subscription(s) for this exactly phone number is/are retrieved (implicit filtering).
      - If 2-legged access token is used, for POST and GET{id}, the presence of ``phoneNumber`` in the request & response is mandatory. For GET (list) the device identifier (``phoneNumber``) could be used as filtering criteria.

      #### sinkCredential presence:

      ``sinkCredential`` is only present in POST request and not provided in POST or GET response.

    # Authorization and authentication

    The "Camara Security and Interoperability Profile" provides details of how an API consumer requests an access token. Please refer to Identity and Consent Management (https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/) for the released version of the profile.

    The specific authorization flows to be used will be agreed upon during the onboarding process, happening between the provider of the application consuming the API and the operator's API exposure platform, taking into account the declared purpose for accessing the API, whilst also being subject to the prevailing legal framework dictated by local legislation.

    In cases where personal data is processed by the API and users can exercise their rights through mechanisms such as opt-in and/or opt-out, the use of three-legged access tokens is mandatory. This ensures that the API remains in compliance with privacy regulations, upholding the principles of transparency and user-centric privacy-by-design.

    # Identifying the device from the access token

    This API requires the API consumer to identify a device as the subject of the API as follows:
    - When the API is invoked using a two-legged access token, the subject will be identified from the optional `phoneNumber` identifier, which therefore MUST be provided.
    - When a three-legged access token is used however, this optional `phoneNumber` identifier MUST NOT be provided, as the subject will be uniquely identified from the access token.

    This approach simplifies API usage for API consumers using a three-legged access token to invoke the API by relying on the information that is associated with the access token and was identified during the authentication process.

    ## Error handling:

    - If the subject cannot be identified from the access token and the optional `phoneNumber` identifier is not included in the request, then the server will return an error with the `422 MISSING_IDENTIFIER` error code.

    - If the subject can be identified from the access token and the optional `phoneNumber` identifier is also included in the request, then the server will return an error with the `422 UNNECESSARY_IDENTIFIER` error code. This will be the case even if the same device is identified by these two methods, as the server is unable to make this comparison.

    # Additional CAMARA error responses

      The list of error codes in this API specification is not exhaustive. Therefore the API specification may not document some non-mandatory error statuses as indicated in `CAMARA API Design Guide`.

      Please refer to the `CAMARA_common.yaml` of the Commonalities Release associated to this API version for a complete list of error responses. The applicable Commonalities Release can be identified in the `API Readiness Checklist` document associated to this API version.

      As a specific rule, error `501 - NOT_IMPLEMENTED` can be only a possible error response if it is explicitly documented in the API.
