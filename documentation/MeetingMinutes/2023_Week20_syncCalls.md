### Sim Swap API

- [Issue #16](https://github.com/camaraproject/SimSwap/issues/16)
- participants discussed a scenario, when Service Provider requests sim swap information from MNO, but MNO has not registered an event of a sim Change. MNO performed API service, but value cannot be returned. Success (200OK) or Error (401 or 404) has implications for API consumer. We continue discusson to find a solution that can be described in API documentation.

### NumberVerify

- [Issue #35](https://github.com/camaraproject/NumberVerification/issues/35)
- participants identified that current API descriptions might be confusing for software developers - two API definitions: MobileConnect & Camara flavors
- Mobile Identity APIs are commercially available and software developers are familiar with existing API design - making a change to existing standard might not be identified by software developers community as a positive change, due to existing Mobile Connect implementations
- additionally, recent changes inside commonalities working group describing the [notation of APIs](https://github.com/camaraproject/WorkingGroups/blob/main/Commonalities/documentation/API-design-guidelines.md#42-inputoutput-resource-definition), requires adoption of Mobile Connect API definition to be compliant with CAMARA
- there is a willingness to assess benefits developers can get when having APIs fully compliant to MC but not same from one implementation to another .
